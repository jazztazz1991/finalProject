# Create React Express App

This site was created by

Cody Chase - Full Stack

For this site we created a responsive site to allow users to users to find local houses near them that are available for rent. The site is also for house owners who can hire us to manage there home and put it up for rent when not occupied.

For future development we plan on increasing functionality for the user and ease of site maintenance for the admin.

To create this app we used a reactJS front-send with a node/express back-end support with mongoDB for data storage.
